I started with creating an frontend and then creating an backend with the help of hono 

`` npm create hono@latest ``

after that you have to give the target directory as backend 
and then select cloudflare workers
and then yes, at all the stuff. 

Created an Routes directory 
Created three route there index.ts user.ts blog.ts
